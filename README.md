# InfiniteControls
Basic controls/UI for game design in XNA/MonoGame

These controls are designed to be simple and effective, as oppostive to some other like NeoControls for example for which author have a goal of a full GUI implementation, like the one offered by OS or windows manager on Unix/Linux which are far too complex and use only for a very few games like strategy games.

Think of them more like what HTML4 (or even 3) offered to CGI designers, as most of the games needs just a menu, a few buttons, checkboxes and sometimes dropdown list for settings, nothing more.

The sets contains a simple button class, a checkbox class (derived from the button), a more advanced button, with time and cooldown feature and a volume selector (the usual UI element to choose sound fx/music volume).
I plan to add also a dropdown list, mostly for choosing game resolution and most probably radio buttons group.

They're will be free to use as much as you want and need :).
